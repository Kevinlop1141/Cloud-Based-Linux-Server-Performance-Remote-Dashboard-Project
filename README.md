This is a project for my Unic course

Thes testTop.sh script is for monitoring the system and the stress_test.sh script is for stressing the system out
inotify-tools and stress need to be downloaded in the ubuntu server.
For optimal behaviour, please run the scripts on 2 different terminals to be able to see the test.
